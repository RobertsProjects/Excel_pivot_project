Excel Project: Pivot Tables and Dashboard Visualization

This Excel project focuses on analyzing a production dataset using pivot tables and a custom-built dashboard. 
The workbook contains four separate pivot tables that summarize key aspects of the data, such as production quantities, categories, and performance metrics. 
These pivot tables feed into a dedicated Dashboard sheet, where the information is visually represented using charts and slicers, enabling dynamic filtering and data exploration. 
The raw data is housed in the Production Dataset sheet, serving as the foundation for the entire analysis. 
This project showcases the use of Excel's pivot table functionality to build a clear and interactive dashboard for production data insights.
